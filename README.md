# Ames Housing Machine Learning Project
** by Yi Cao, Ling Ge Zeng, and Daniel Choy

### Introduction

House flipping is a common real estate investment strategy by purchasing a property and selling it in the hopes of making a profit. This can mean that sometimes, flipping a house means the temporary owner has to make a lot of repairs or renovations until the owner can sell it for more than the investment cost. Hence, the goal is to buy low and sell high. 

However, house flipping can sometimes be financially risky due to the uncertainty of the market and 

In this collaborative project, our objective is to: 
1. explore Ames Housing Market in the context of house flipping market;
2. train machine learning model to predict future housing sale prices in Ames, Iowa
3. estimate the price differences made by specific house features 
4. produce a practical guide for those looking to flip homes for a profit.

### About the Data

The data contains 2558 observations and 190 features on homes sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. During the analysis, some additional features were engineered to simplify and sharpen the focus of our subsequent models.
